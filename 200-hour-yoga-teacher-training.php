      <div class="underline-wrap"><img src="images/new/heading.png" alt="underline icon"  class="underline-icon lazy"></div>
      <p>Mahakaal Yogapeeth 200 hour Yoga Teacher Training in Rishikesh is a 4-week training that combines the best yogic wisdom with the latest from the exciting world of movement research.</p>
      <p class="mb-0">Our 200 hour Yoga Teacher Training in Rishikesh course is an immersion in the physical practice of yoga. We’ll break movements down according to anatomy (how we’re built), kinesiology (us in motion), and biomechanics (how external and internal forces act on us). You’ll spend time practicing, modifying, analyzing the purpose of postures, and learning how postures work for bodies with different goals and limitations. This teaching is very accessible – no previous training in anatomy, etc., required – with plenty of time to review, practice, explore, and grow more confident that you know what you’re doing in your practice before you try to teach that practice to other people.</p>

     <h3 class="common-heading-bottom text-center mb-5">WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE 200 HOUR TEACHER TRAINING COURSE: (Course Curriculum)</h3>
     <div class="underline-wrap"><img src="images/new/heading.png" alt="underline icon"  class="underline-icon lazy"></div>
   </div>
   <div class="col-lg-12">
    <p>Our curriculum includes Asana (deep understanding of the alignment in all postures), Pranayama (several breath techniques), Yoga Philosophy (concentrating on the eight limbs of yoga), Meditation (tools to create your meditation practice), Anatomy (applied anatomy for the postures), Ayurveda studies (the sister science of yoga), Mantra (the study of sound), Smart Sequencing (the understanding of how to create a safe, exciting flow with modifications), and Subtle Body (basic knowledge of the Chakra System.</p>
    <p class="course-schedule"><span class="schedule-time">Techniques, Training, and Practice: </span><span class="schedule-task">The goal is to have a level one training that is Clear, Concise, and Practical to empower the students to teach a level one class that is safe, conscious, and interesting. Each student will understand the components of each asana (posture) to empower them to create intelligent class sequencing.</span></p>
    <p class="course-schedule"><span class="schedule-time">Hatha Yoga: </span><span class="schedule-task">In the 200-hour yoga teacher training, you'll dive into Hatha Yoga – perfect for beginners. This course covers all the physical aspects of yoga in a detailed way. Hatha Yoga, made up of 'Ha' meaning 'Sun' and 'Tha' meaning 'Moon', unites these opposite forces. It's all about strengthening your body inside and out.</span></p>
    <p class="course-schedule"><span class="schedule-time">Anatomy: </span><span class="schedule-task">Studying yoga anatomy is like exploring the science of the body – understanding organs, bones, muscles, joints, and tissues. It's crucial for yoga practitioners as it adds a holistic approach to your practice. Beyond the physical structure, you'll delve into body processes. These aspects go hand in hand. To grasp how the body moves, it's important to comprehend both.</span></p>
    <p class="course-schedule"><span class="schedule-time">Alignment:</span><span class="schedule-task">The alignment breakdown of each posture with asana points. As a student, you will learn over eighty postures in a sequence with options so that you understand how to build an anatomically safe and vibrant class.</span></p>
    <p class="course-schedule"><span class="schedule-time">History of Posture:</span><span class="schedule-task">Understanding the history and story behind the posture’s name.</span></p>
    <p class="course-schedule"><span class="schedule-time">Adjustments:</span><span class="schedule-task">Adjustments and learning how to assist in each posture to guide the student deeper into the asana.</span></p>
    <p class="course-schedule"><span class="schedule-time">Principals of alignment:</span><span class="schedule-task">Setting a student up for success through aligning the Mind, Body, and Spirit to create a solid foundation for every class.</span></p>
    <p class="course-schedule"><span class="schedule-time">Observation:</span><span class="schedule-task">Each student will learn the importance of observing a student to understand where to support their needs in every aspect of their yoga practice.</span></p>
    <p class="course-schedule"><span class="schedule-time">Satkarma: </span><span class="schedule-task">In the 200-hour YTTC, you'll dive into Shatkarma Kriyas, a vital part of the course. These are six purification techniques that support your yogic journey. Engaging in these practices is like giving your biological processes a tune-up, ensuring they run smoothly. Shatkarma kriyas play a role in the proper functioning of 11 body processes, covering circulation, excretion, respiration, digestion, and more. Hatha Yoga introduces you to six purification techniques: Nauli, Basti, Dhouti, Neti, Trataka, and Kapalbhati. Together, they contribute to fully detoxifying the body.</span></p>
    <p class="course-schedule"><span class="schedule-time">Assisting and Correcting:</span><span class="schedule-task">Our students will learn safe and straightforward adjustments to assist each student in their whole practice better. They will learn how to listen and provide techniques to best approach a student with unconditional love.</span></p>
    <p class="course-schedule"><span class="schedule-time">Yoga Philosophy:</span><span class="schedule-task">In your training, you'll explore different philosophical schools. In the yoga realm, Samkhya Philosophy holds significant importance, along with Vedanta, Uttara, and Yoga. The school's teachers will guide you to understand these foundations, empowering you to share this wisdom with your students. This not only enhances your knowledge but also fosters a deeper sense of conviction. As you delve into the texts supporting your yoga practice, you'll experience a spiritual awakening and heightened awareness.</span></p>

       <p>I highly recommend Mahakaal Yogpeeth’s 200 hour Yoga Teacher Training. I have just completed the training and am so glad I took it. I felt supported in the learning process, and the course was full of wisdom and fun. The course structure ensures you have time to implement your learning and get direct, personalized feedback from the trainer. The course content is detailed and easy to follow and learn. Though I have so much more to learn, this course has helped me feel more grounded and confident in sharing this beautiful practice with others.</p>

     <p>I have wanted to do a 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training for a long time, and I’m so glad I chose dynamic mindfulness. Mahakaal Yogapeeth did a fantastic job; the combination of Hatha and Ashtanga gave a lot of flexibility and was doable alongside a full-time job. We learned a lot on many topics, from the history of yoga to the anatomy of the body and more philosophical subjects. This experience went beyond my expectations; it was very transformative, and I feel super grateful for it.</p>

   <p>I did 200 hours of Dynamic Mindfulness training, which was a profound experience. This training is based on teaching with care and wisdom the elements of Yoga and meditation, from the history and foundation of Yoga and Meditation, anatomy of the body and movement based on new knowledge about somatic and biomechanics, helpful guidance on how to be a yoga teacher and all that goes with it and of course, deepening into the practice of Yoga from a non-dogmatic point of view, with a kind approach and from a very reflective perspective.</p>
